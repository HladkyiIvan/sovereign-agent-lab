# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Scenario 1: first choice unavailable
# Quote the specific message where the agent changed course. Min 20 words.
SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
The Bow Bar returned status=full and capacity=80, failing both constraints.
The agent then checked The Haymarket Vaults (met all constraints) and continued
checking The Guilford Arms and The Albanach before confirming The Albanach as the venue.
"""

SCENARIO_1_FALLBACK_VENUE = "The Albanach"

# Scenario 2: impossible constraint (300 guests)
# Did the agent recommend a pub name not in the known venues list?
SCENARIO_2_HALLUCINATED = False   # True or False

# Paste the final [AI] message.
SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
None of the known venues meet the capacity and dietary requirements. The Albanach, The Haymarket Vaults, and The Guilford Arms have a capacity of 180, 160, and 200 respectively, which is less than the required capacity of 300. The Bow Bar has a capacity of 80, which is also less than the required capacity, and it is currently full. Therefore, none of the known venues can accommodate 300 people with vegan options.

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
The refusal is partially acceptable — the agent correctly avoided calling irrelevant tools
and did not hallucinate a train schedule. However, the response is unhelpful and confusing:
a real booking assistant should explicitly state it cannot answer questions about train times
and politely redirect the user to an appropriate service (e.g. National Rail), rather than
claiming the input "lacks necessary details."

MOST_SURPRISING = """
In Scenario 1, the agent did not stop after finding The Haymarket Vaults (which met all
constraints). It continued checking The Guilford Arms and The Albanach before settling on
The Albanach as the confirmed venue — even though The Haymarket Vaults was already a valid
answer. This over-exploration suggests the agent planned all tool calls upfront rather than
stopping as soon as a satisfying result was found, which could be wasteful in production.
